* Change "basis" key word arguments to "phi". This is more consistent
  with the RBF literature

* Create a module that is specifically intended for solving partioned
  linear systems of the form

    | A G^T | | a |   | x |
    | G 0   | | b | = | y |

  This equation is ubiquitous in RBF applications and there should be
  a designated module for solving it efficiently. It should also be
  able to handle both sparse and dense matrices for A.
