This module defines a class, `GaussianProcess`, which is an
abstraction that allows one to easily work with Gaussian processes.
One main use for the `GaussianProcess` class is Gaussian process
regression (GPR). GPR is also known as Kriging or Least Squares
Collocation.  It is a technique for constructing a continuous function
from discrete observations by incorporating a stochastic prior model
for the underlying function.  GPR is performed with the `condition`
method of a `GaussianProcess` instance. In addition to GPR, the
`GaussianProcess` class can be used for basic arithmetic with Gaussian
processes and for generating random samples of a Gaussian process.

There are several existing python packages for Gaussian processes (See
www.gaussianprocess.org for an updated list of packages). This module
was written because existing software lacked support for 1) Gaussian
processes with added basis functions 2) analytical differentiation of
Gaussian processes and 3) conditioning a Gaussian process with
derivative constraints. Other software packages have a strong focus on
optimizing hyperparameters based on data likelihood. This module does
not include any optimization routines and hyperparameters are always
explicitly specified by the user. However, the `GaussianProcess` class
contains the `likelihood` method which can be used with functions from
`scipy.optimize` to construct a hyperparameter optimization routine.


Gaussian processes
==================
To understand what a Gaussian process is, let's first consider a
random vector :math:`\mathbf{u}` which has a multivariate normal
distribution with mean :math:`\\bar{\mathbf{u}}` and covariance matrix
:math:`\mathbf{C}`. That is to say, each element :math:`u_i` of
:math:`\mathbf{u}` is a normally distributed random variable
with mean :math:`\\bar{u}_i` and covariance :math:`C_{ij}` with
element :math:`u_j`. Each element also has context (e.g., time or
position) denoted as :math:`x_i`. A Gaussian process is the continuous
analogue to the multivariate normal vector, where the context for a
Gaussian process is a continuous variable :math:`x`, rather than the
discrete variable :math:`x_i`. A Gaussian process :math:`u_o` is
defined in terms of a mean *function* :math:`\\bar{u}`, and a
covariance *function* :math:`C_u`. We write this definition of
:math:`u_o` more concisely as

.. math::
  u_o \\sim \\mathcal{GP}\\left(\\bar{u},C_u\\right).

Analogous to each element of the random vector :math:`\mathbf{u}`, the
Gaussian process at :math:`x`, denoted as :math:`u_o(x)`, is a
normally distributed random variable with mean :math:`\\bar{u}(x)` and
covariance :math:`C_u(x, x')` with :math:`u_o(x')`.

In this module, we adopt a more general definition of a Gaussian
process by incorporating basis functions. These basis functions are
added to Gaussian processes to account for arbitrary shifts or trends
in the data that we are trying to model. To be more precise, we
consider a Gaussian process :math:`u(x)` to be the combination of
:math:`u_o(x)`, a *proper* Gaussian process, and a set of :math:`m`
basis functions, :math:`\mathbf{p}_u(x) = \{p_i(x)\}_{i=1}^m`, whose
coefficients, :math:`\{c_i\}_{i=1}^m`, have infinite variance. We then
express :math:`u(x)` as

.. math::
  u(x) = u_o(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m c_i p_i(x).

When we include these basis functions, the Gaussian process
:math:`u(x)` becomes improper because it has infinite variance. So
when we refer to the covariance function for a Gaussian process
:math:`u(x)`, we are actually referring to the covariance function for
its proper component :math:`u_o(x)`.

Throughout this module we will define a Gaussian process `u(x)` in
terms of its mean function :math:`\\bar{u}(x)`, its covariance
function :math:`C_u(x, x')`, as well as its basis functions
:math:`\mathbf{p}_u(x)`.

We consider five operations on Gaussian processes: addition,
subtraction, scaling, differentiation, and conditioning. Each
operation produces another Gaussian process which possesses the same
five operations. These operations are described below.


Operations on Gaussian processes
================================

Addition
--------
Two uncorrelated Gaussian processes, :math:`u` and :math:`v`, can be 
added as

.. math::
  u(x) + v(x) = z(x)

where the mean, covariance, and basis functions for :math:`z` are

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) + \\bar{v}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = C_u(x,x') + C_v(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x) \cup \mathbf{p}_v(x).

Two `GaussianProcess` instances can be added with the `add` method or
the `+` operator.

Subtraction
-----------
A Gaussian process can be subtracted from another Gaussian processes 
as

.. math::
  u(x) - v(x) = z(x) 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) - \\bar{v}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = C_u(x,x') + C_v(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x) \cup \mathbf{p}_v(x).

Two `GaussianProcess` instances can be subtracted with the `subtract`
method or the `-` operator.

Scaling
-------
A Gaussian process can be scaled by a constant as 

.. math::
  cu(x) = z(x) 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = c\\bar{u}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = c^2C_u(x,x'),

and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x).

A `GaussianProcess` instance can be scaled with the `scale` method or
the `*` operator.

Differentiation
---------------
A Gaussian process can be differentiated with respect to :math:`x_i` 
as

.. math::
  \\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} u(x) = z(x), 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\\bar{u}(x),
  
.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = \\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_i'}
              C_u(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \\left\{\\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} p_k(x) 
                    \mid p_k(x) \in \mathbf{p}_u(x)\\right\}

A `GaussianProcess` instance can be differentiated with the
`differentiate` method.

Conditioning
------------
A Gaussian process can be conditioned with :math:`q` noisy 
observations of :math:`u(x)`, :math:`\mathbf{d}=\{d_i\}_{i=1}^q`, 
which have been made at locations :math:`\mathbf{y}=\{y_i\}_{i=1}^q`. 
These observations have noise with zero mean and covariance described 
by :math:`\mathbf{C_d}`. The conditioned Gaussian process is

.. math::
  u(x) | \mathbf{d} = z(x) 
  
where
  
.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) + 
                \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y})
                \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})^{-1}
                \mathbf{r}^*,

.. math::
  C_{z}(x,x') = C_u(x,x') - 
                \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y}) 
                \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})^{-1}
                \mathbf{k}(x',\mathbf{y})^T,                

and

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \emptyset.

In the above equations we use the augmented covariance matrices, 
:math:`\mathbf{k}` and :math:`\mathbf{K}`, whose entries are

.. math::
  \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y}) = 
  \\left[
  \\begin{array}{cc}
    \\left[C_u(x,y_i)\\right]_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}} 
    & \mathbf{p}_u(x) \\\\
  \\end{array}  
  \\right]

and      
           
.. math::
  \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y}) = 
  \\left[
  \\begin{array}{cc}
    \mathbf{C_d} + \\left[C_u(y_i,y_j)\\right]_
    {y_i,y_j \in \mathbf{y}\\times\mathbf{y}} 
    & [\mathbf{p}_u(y_i)]_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}} \\\\
    [\mathbf{p}_u(y_i)]^T_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}}   
    & \mathbf{0}    \\\\
  \\end{array}  
  \\right].

We define the residual vector as

.. math::
  \mathbf{r} = \\left([d_i - \\bar{u}(y_i)]_{i=1}^q\\right)^T
  
and :math:`\mathbf{r}^*` is the residual vector which has been
suitably padded with zeros. Note that there are no basis functions in 
:math:`z` because it is assumed that there is enough data in 
:math:`\mathbf{d}` to constrain the basis functions in :math:`u`. If 
:math:`\mathbf{d}` is not sufficiently informative then 
:math:`\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})` will not be invertible. A necessary but 
not sufficient condition for :math:`\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})` to be 
invertible is that :math:`q \geq m`.

A `GaussianProcess` instance can be conditioned with the `condition`
method.

Some commonly used Gaussian processes
=====================================
The `GaussianProcess` class is quite general as it can be instantiated
with any user-specified mean function, covariance function, or set of
basis functions. However, supplying these requisite functions can be
laborious. This module contains several constructors to simplify
instantiating some commonly used types of Gaussian processes. The
types of Gaussian processes which have constructors are listed below.


Isotropic Gaussian Processes
----------------------------
An isotropic Gaussian process has a constant mean and a covariance
function which can be written as a function of
:math:`r = ||x - x'||_2`. To put more explicitly, an isotropic
Gaussian processes has the mean function

.. math::
  \\bar{u}(x) = \mu,
  
and the covariance function

.. math::
  C_u(x,x') = \sigma^2 \phi(r\ ; \epsilon), 

Where :math:`\phi(r\ ; \epsilon)` is a positive definite radial basis
function with shape parameter :math:`\epsilon`. One common choice for
:math:`\phi` is the squared exponential function,

.. math::
  \phi(r\ ;\epsilon) = \exp\\left(\\frac{-r^2}{\epsilon^2}\\right),

which has the useful property of being infinitely differentiable. An
instance of an isotropic `GaussianProcess` can be created with the
function `gpiso`. A `GaussianProcess` with a squared exponential
covariance function can be created with the function `gpse`.


Gaussian Process with a Gibbs covariance function
-------------------------------------------------
A Gaussian process with a Gibbs covariance function is useful because,
unlike for isotropic Gaussian processes, it can have a spatially
variable lengthscale. Given some user-specified lengthscale function
:math:`\ell_d(x)`, which gives the lengthscale at :math:`x \in
\mathbb{R}^D` along dimension :math:`d`, the Gibbs covariance function
is

.. math::
    C_u(x, x') = 
    \sigma^2    
    \prod_{d=1}^D \\left(
    \\frac{2 \ell_d(x) \ell_d(x')}{\ell_d(x)^2 + \ell_d(x')^2}
    \\right)^{1/2}
    \exp\\left(-\sum_{d=1}^D
    \\frac{(x_d - x_d')^2}{\ell_d(x)^2 + \ell_d(x')^2}
    \\right).

An instance of a `GaussianProcess` with a Gibbs covariance function
can be created with the function `gpgibbs`.


Gaussian Process with mononomial basis functions
------------------------------------------------
Polynomials are often added to Gaussian processes to improve their
ability to describe offsets and trends in data. The function `gppoly`
is used to create a `GaussianProcess` with zero mean, zero covariance,
and a set of monomial basis function that span the space of all
polynomials with some degree, :math:`d`. For example, if :math:`x \in
\mathbb{R}^2` and :math:`d=1`, then the monomial basis functions would
be

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_u(x) = \{1,x_1,x_2\}.

The function `gpbasis` can be used to create a `GaussianProcess` with
any other type of basis functions.


Examples
========
Here we provide a basic example that demonstrates creating a
`GaussianProcess` and performing GPR. Suppose we have 5 scalar valued
observations `d` that were made at locations `x`, and we want
interpolate these observations with GPR

>>> x = [[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]]
>>> d = [2.3, 2.2, 1.7, 1.8, 2.4]

First we define our prior for the underlying function that we want to
interpolate. We assume an isotropic `GaussianProcess` with a squared
exponential covariance function and the parameter :math:`\mu=0.0`,
:math:`\sigma^2=1.0` and :math:`\epsilon=0.5`.

>>> from rbf.basis import se
>>> from rbf.gauss import gpiso
>>> gp_prior = gpiso(se, (0.0, 1.0, 0.5))

We also want to include an unknown constant offset to our prior model,
which is done with the command

>>> from rbf.gauss import gppoly
>>> gp_prior += gppoly(0)

Now we condition the prior with the observations to form the posterior

>>> gp_post = gp_prior.condition(x, d)

We can now evaluate the mean and covariance of the posterior anywhere
using the `mean` or `covariance` method. We can also evaluate just the
mean and standard deviation with the `meansd` method.

>>> m, s = gp_post.meansd([[0.5], [1.5], [2.5], [3.5]])

def likelihood(d, mu, sigma, p=None):
  ''' 
  Returns the log likelihood. If `p` is not specified, then the likelihood is
  the probability of observing `d` from a normally distributed random vector
  with mean `mu` and covariance `sigma`. If `d` is expected to contain some
  unknown linear combination of basis vectors (e.g. a constant offset or linear
  trend), then `p` should be specified with those basis vectors as its columns.
  When `p` is specified, the restricted likelihood is returned. The restricted
  likelihood is the probability of observing `R.dot(d)` from a normally
  distributed random vector with mean `R.dot(mu)` and covariance
  `R.dot(sigma).dot(R.T)`, where `R` is a matrix with rows that are orthogonal
  to the columns of `p`. In other words, if `p` is specified then the component
  of `d` which lies along the columns of `p` will be ignored.
  
  The restricted likelihood was first described by [1] and it is covered in
  more general reference books such as [2]. Both [1] and [2] are good sources
  for additional information.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  d : (N,) array
    observations
  
  mu : (N,) array
    mean of the random vector
  
  sigma : (N,) array, (N, N) array, or (N, N) scipy sparse matrix    
    If this is an (N,) array then it describes one standard deviation of the
    random vector. If this is an (N, N) array then it describes the
    covariances.
  
  p : (N, P) array, optional 
    Basis vectors. If specified, then `d` is assumed to contain some unknown
    linear combination of the columns of `p`.

  Notes
  -----
  Unlike other functions in this module, if the covariance matrix is not
  numerically positive definite then this function will fail with an error
  rather than trying to coerce it into a positive definite matrix.

def outliers(d, s, mu=None, sigma=None, p=None, tol=4.0, maxitr=50):
  ''' 
  Uses a data editing algorithm to identify outliers in `d`. Outliers are
  considered to be the data that are abnormally inconsistent with the Gaussian
  process described by `mu` (mean), `sigma` (covariance), and `p` (basis
  vectors). This function can only be used for data with nonzero, uncorrelated
  noise.

  The data editing algorithm first conditions the Gaussian process with the
  observations, then it compares each residual (`d` minus the expected value of
  the posterior divided by `sigma`) to the RMS of residuals. Data with
  residuals greater than `tol` times the RMS are identified as outliers. This
  process is then repeated using the subset of `d` which were not flagged as
  outliers. If no new outliers are detected in an iteration then the algorithm
  stops.

  Parameters
  ----------  
  d : (N,) float array
    Observations
  
  s : (N,) float array
    One standard deviation uncertainty on the observations. 
  
  mu : (N,) float array, optional
    Mean of the Gaussian process at the observation points. Defaults to zeros.

  sigma : (N,) array, (N, N) array, or (N, N) scipy sparse matrix, optional
    Covariance of the Gaussian process at the observation points. Defaults to
    zeros.
  
  p : (N, P) float array, optional
    Basis vectors for the Gaussian process evaluated at the observation points.
    Defaults to an (N, 0) array.
  
  tol : float, optional
    Outlier tolerance. Smaller values make the algorithm more likely to
    identify outliers. A good value is 4.0 and this should not be set any lower
    than 2.0.
  
  maxitr : int, optional
    Maximum number of iterations.

class GaussianProcess(object):
  ''' 
  A `GaussianProcess` instance represents a stochastic process which is defined
  in terms of a mean function, a covariance function, and (optionally) a set of
  basis functions. This class is used to perform basic operations on Gaussian
  processes which include addition, subtraction, scaling, differentiation,
  sampling, and conditioning.
    
  Parameters
  ----------
  mean : function 
    Function which returns either the mean of the Gaussian process at `x` or a
    specified derivative of the mean at `x`. This has the call signature
    
    `out = mean(x)`

    or 
    
    `out = mean(x, diff)`
    
    `x` is an (N, D) array of positions. `diff` is a (D,) int array derivative
    specification (e.g. [0, 1] indicates to return the derivative with respect
    to the second spatial dimension). `out` must be an (N,) array. If this
    function only takes one argument then it is assumed to not be
    differentiable and the `differentiate` method for the `GaussianProcess`
    instance will return an error.

  covariance : function
    Function which returns either the covariance of the Gaussian process
    between points `x1` and `x2` or the covariance of the specified derivatives
    of the Gaussian process between points `x1` and `x2`. This has the call
    signature
    
    `out = covariance(x1, x2)`

    or 
    
    `out = covariance(x1, x2, diff1, diff2)`

    `x1` and `x2` are (N, D) and (M, D) arrays of positions, respectively.
    `diff1` and `diff2` are (D,) int array derivative specifications. `out` can
    be an (N, M) array or scipy sparse matrix (csc format would be most
    efficient). If this function only takes two arguments, then it is assumed
    to not be differentiable and the `differentiate` method for the
    `GaussianProcess` instance will return an error.

  basis : function, optional
    Function which returns either the basis functions evaluated at `x` or the
    specified derivative of the basis functions evaluated at `x`. This has the
    call signature

    `out = basis(x)`

    or 
    
    `out = basis(x, diff)`

    `x` is an (N, D) array of positions. `diff` is a (D,) int array derivative
    specification. `out` is an (N, P) array where each column corresponds to a
    basis function. By default, a `GaussianProcess` instance contains no basis
    functions. If this function only takes one argument, then it is assumed to
    not be differentiable and the `differentiate` method for the
    `GaussianProcess` instance will return an error.
        
  dim : int, optional  
    Fixes the spatial dimensions of the `GaussianProcess` instance. An error
    will be raised if method arguments have a conflicting number of spatial
    dimensions.
    
  Notes
  -----
  1. This class does not check whether the specified covariance function is
  positive definite, making it easy to construct an invalid `GaussianProcess`
  instance. For this reason, one may prefer to create a `GaussianProcess` with
  one of the constructor functions (e.g., `gpse` or `gppoly`).
  
  2. A `GaussianProcess` returned by `add`, `subtract`, `scale`,
  `differentiate`, and `condition` has `mean`, `covariance`, and `basis`
  function which calls the `mean`, `covariance`, and `basis` functions of its
  parents. Due to this recursive implementation, the number of generations of
  children is limited by the maximum recursion depth.

  Examples
  --------    
  Create a `GaussianProcess` describing Brownian motion

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from rbf.gauss import GaussianProcess
  >>> def mean(x): return np.zeros(x.shape[0]) 
  >>> def cov(x1, x2): return np.min(np.meshgrid(x1[:, 0], x2[:, 0], indexing='ij'), axis=0)
  >>> gp = GaussianProcess(mean, cov, dim=1) # Brownian motion is 1D

    Uses a data editing algorithm to identify outliers in `d`. Outliers are
    considered to be the data that are abnormally inconsistent with the
    `GaussianProcess`. This method can only be used for data that has nonzero,
    uncorrelated noise.

    The data editing algorithm first conditions the `GaussianProcess` with the
    observations, then it compares each residual (`d` minus the expected value
    of the posterior divided by `sigma`) to the RMS of residuals. Data with
    residuals greater than `tol` times the RMS are identified as outliers. This
    process is then repeated using the subset of `d` which were not flagged as
    outliers. If no new outliers are detected in an iteration then the
    algorithms stops.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    y : (N, D) float array
